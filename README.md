# oauth2id
SSO Portal based on oauth2 id protocol


# Dev env setup

Setup the puma-dev to support https in local.

```
brew install puma/puma/puma-dev
sudo puma-dev -setup
puma-dev -install
cd ~/.puma-dev
ln -s /Users/<username>/git/oauth2id oauth2id
```

Then visit the `https://oauth2id.test` and accept the invalid https certificate, for higher version MacOS, need opening Keychain Access and moving the Puma-dev CA certificate into the System column under keychains then restarting the browser, [it's a known issue](https://github.com/puma/puma-dev/issues/84#issuecomment-252339375)

In order to make sure Faraday running in local also works well in https, we also need to add Puma-dev CA in OpenSSL library trust list as well, the OpenSSL CA is by default at `/usr/local/etc/openssl/cert.pem`, since we already have valid MacOS Pumda-dev CA in system, we can use [openssl-osx-ca](https://github.com/raggi/openssl-osx-ca) to regenerate the `cert.pem` file so just installs and regenerate `cert.pem` file.
